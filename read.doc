React memo -> It can be used to render component only when 
its props got changed rather than for evry parent component rendering

React Fragment -> Instaed of a div at top for a component, we use this 
React Lazy, suspend -> In order not to render that component on app initialization, rather render it on some click

React Hooks->

UseState -> Returns two array values -> 1)Current State 2)Function which can update state

UseEffect -> Acts as componentDidMount if second argument is an empty array[]
